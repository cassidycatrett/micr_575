## Final Proposal

I plan to create an in depth Quarto document to run phenootypic analyses (summary statistics, correlations). This will involve data cleaning steps and the creation of functions to automate these analyses. This will benefit my current dissertation work as well as my current and future lab mates working with novel phenotypes and other animal breeding projects.
