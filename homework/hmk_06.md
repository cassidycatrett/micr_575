This is a nice plot to me because of how clear and easy to read it is.
The colors being a gradient of the three main colors allow for enough
contrast between each one to make it easy to decipher each bar. I also
like how there is a color legend for each of the three plots as it makes
it easier to reference back what each color represents. Additionally,
the size and spacing of the plots for each part of the figure is enough
space that I can see information for each group of cattle.

## Bad Plot

This is a pretty difficult to read figure. The patterns are too similar
to each other to be able to easily decipher where one bar ends and the
next one begins. Also, the various traits on the x-axis are too close
together and make it confusing to relate with columns go with which
trait. I think making this plot longer and patterns more contrasting
will aid in understanding for this plot.
